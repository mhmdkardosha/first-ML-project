# ML simple project
- This is my first machine-learning project.
- After learning about EDA, preprocessing, and supervised learning, I applied my knowledge to the "Englandweather (2006-2016) preprocessing" dataset from Kaggle.
-  I conducted EDA and preprocessing, then trained my model using four different models to determine the best fit for my data.
